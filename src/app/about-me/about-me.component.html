            <p data-aos="fade-right">I am a front-end developer based in TÃ¼bingen, Germany with experience in building
                web apps using JavaScript & Angular. My journey in IT began many years ago during my studies, when I
                started to write simple add-on programs using Python in order to analyze spatial data using graphical
                information systems.

                </div>
                <p>Since then, I have continued to dive deeper into the world of technology, and have explored various
                    programming languages and tools. Additionally, my father-in-law works as a web developer, so I
                    already had exposure to the world of professional developement.</p>

                <p>In October 2022 I decided to go professional myself and started an online coding seminar at the "Developer
                    Akademie", a professional coding school based in munich. It has been an incredible journey thus far,
                    filled with challenges, learning and growth.<br>
                    I am looking forward to start my career in IT!</p>
